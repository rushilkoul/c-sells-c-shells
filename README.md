i dont know shit about C but who does beginner projects amirite

im using wsl 
```bash
sudo apt install build-essential gdb valgrind   # fun prerequisites (gdb isnt really REQUIRED but cmon)

make  # compiles it to ./c_sells_c_shells 

make run
```

you can also run while checking for memory leaks how cool is that

```bash
make memcheck
```
